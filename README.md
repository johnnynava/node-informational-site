Basic informational site I made with Node.js and Typescript.

The page should take you to a specific html file depending on the url and it should take you to a 404 page if the filename is not found.

This is just for me to learn how to use NodeJS so it's extremely simple.

To run it go into the dist folder and run:
node index.js
