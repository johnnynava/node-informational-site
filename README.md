Basic informational site I made with Node.js and Typescript.

Rebuilt on Jan 28 using Express. (see commit history for legacy code)

The page should take you to a specific html file depending on the url and it should take you to a 404 page if the filename is not found.

This is the start of me learning how to use NodeJS so it's extremely simple.

To run it go into the dist folder and run:
node index.js
